A couple things to start off.

Make sure to have Node.js installed in order to run the react app.

Link to install Node.js:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After cloning the repo (or updating your current branches with git pull) go ahead and cd into the app directory called "fruit-salad".

In order to run the app we need to install some dependecies.
Do so by running npm install in the terminal.

Finally, to run the app run npm start.

This will run our app on your local machine under localhost:3000.
